<h1>ExpressTalk App</h1>

<h2>1. Description</h2>
Create a real-time chat application where users can join different chat rooms and communicate with each other in real-time. This project will help you dive into WebSocket programming with Express.js and Socket.io.

<h2>2. Key Features</h2>

- **User Authentication**: Allow users to sign up and log in to the chat application. You can implement this using username/password authentication or integrate with OAuth providers like Google or Facebook.

- **Chat Rooms**: Users can create new chat rooms or join existing ones. Each chat room should have a unique identifier and maintain its own conversation history.
    
- **Real-Time Communication**: Implement real-time communication between users in the same chat room using WebSockets. Whenever a user sends a message, it should be immediately displayed to all other users in the same room.

- **User Presence**: Show which users are currently online in each chat room. Implement features like displaying when a user is typing.
    
- **Message History**: Allow users to view the message history for a chat room, so they can catch up on previous conversations when they join.
    
- **File Sharing**: Enable users to share files (e.g., images, documents) with each other within the chat rooms.

- **Notifications**: Implement notifications for new messages, mentions, or when a user is invited to a chat room.

<h2>3. Technologies to Use</h2>

- **Express.js** for handling HTTP requests and serving static assets.

- **Socket.io** for real-time communication between the server and clients.

- **MongoDB** for storing user information, chat rooms, and messages.

- **ReactJs** for building the frontend interface.

- **JWT** for user authentication and authorization.
